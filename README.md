# 🚗 Fatal Accident Data Analysis (U.S. - 2022)

A data science project focused on exploring and understanding the critical factors that influence fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States. This research-driven analysis uses Python-based tools to uncover temporal, spatial, environmental, and behavioral trends in fatal crash incidents.

---

## 📂 Project Summary

This project leverages real-world data from the **Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)** 2022 dataset to perform a structured **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can guide improvements in road safety and crash prevention strategies.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data handling and preprocessing
- **NumPy** – numerical operations and logical filtering
- **Seaborn** – statistical data visualization
- **Matplotlib** – plots and graphs
- **(Optional)** Folium / GeoPandas – geographic mapping

---

## 📈 Research Objectives

1. **Analyze temporal crash patterns by hour of day**
2. **Study interaction of weather conditions and lighting on fatal crashes**
3. **Identify geographic hotspots using latitude/longitude and urban-rural class**
4. **Evaluate effect of roadway type and work zones on crash severity**
5. **Assess impact of drunk drivers on multi-fatality occurrences**
6. **Examine junction proximity and fatal crash severity**
7. **Track crash trends by days of the week and months**
8. **Measure delay between crash time and time of recorded death**

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

- **Source**: [NHTSA FARS Dataset (2022)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)
- **Format**: CSV (Extracted from ZIP)
- **Columns**: 20+ including crash time, road class, weather, light, location, fatalities, driver behavior
- **License**: Public domain (Government dataset)

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- 🕒 Fatal crashes peak between **5 PM and 7 PM**
- 🌧️ Poor lighting and bad weather are linked to higher fatality rates
- 📍 Spatial clustering shows hotspots in **urban regions**, though **rural crashes** often have higher fatality counts
- 🧃 Presence of drunk drivers significantly raises multi-fatality chances
- 🚧 Junctions and work zones are high-risk road features
- 🧠 Some deaths are recorded **after a delay**, hinting at emergency response gaps


---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add predictive modeling (classification of high-risk zones)
- Build a dashboard for live crash analytics
- Integrate interactive maps using Folium
